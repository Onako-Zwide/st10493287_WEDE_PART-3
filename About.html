            <h2>About FreshMart ORGANICS</h2>
            <p>FreshMart ORGANICS is a retail organization founded in Grahamstown (now Makhanda) in 2017 by entrepreneurs, Onako Zwide & Alizwa Tshantshi. We aim to provide organic products that are sustainably grown, sold fresh, and affordable to promote healthy living among individuals.</p>
            <p>We started as a small farmer’s market stall and have grown into a retail brand offering a variety of organic fruits, vegetables, dairy, and products. Our emphasis is “Organic” and we offer plant-based milk (oat/soy/almond), freshly squeezed juices, organic cheese and yoghurt, and organic skincare products (soaps, lotions, oils).</p>
            <p>Our eco-friendly products include biodegradable cleaning products, reusable shopping bags, and kitchenware (spoons, plates, and straws).</p>
